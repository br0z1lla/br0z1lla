	Bard has introduced a computing component
	into <a href="http://languageandthinking.bard.edu/about">Language
	& Thinking</a>, its intensive writing program held during the
	three weeks before the first semester. The component exposes
	all first-year students to the power of code as language and
	computational thinking.
